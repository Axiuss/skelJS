	<h2>How It Works</h2>
	<p>skel.js neatly combines the following components:</p>
	<section class="features">
		<div class="row">
			<section class="6u">
				<span class="icon icon-th featured"></span>
				<h3>CSS Grid System</h3>
				<p>A 12 column CSS grid system with powerful features and a clear, concise, simple to use syntax.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="6u">
				<span class="icon icon-custom-responsive featured"></span>
				<h3>Breakpoint Handler</h3>
				<p>A streamlined replacement for CSS media queries that's smarter and super easy to work with.</p>
			</section>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<section class="6u">
				<span class="icon icon-custom-css featured"></span>
				<h3>CSS Shortcuts</h3>
				<p>Handy shortcuts to deal with common CSS tasks, like browser resets and box model tweaks.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="6u">
				<span class="icon icon-plus-sign featured"></span>
				<h3>Plugin Architecture</h3>
				<p>Opens the door to doing even more with skel.js, both now (using the <a href="#">skel-ui.js</a> plugin) and in the future.</p>
			</section>
		</div>
	</section>
	<p>All designed to work together, and all designed to fit in just a single 18kb file. skel.js also has no 
	dependencies and will play nice with other libraries and frameworks.</p>
